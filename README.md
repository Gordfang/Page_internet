# Page_internet

The goal of this project is to create a small but usefull GUI to manage a set of url to be used by any browser
By doing this the user can won some time (don't be fool, it's like 5 seconde) to launch for exemple a set of page he used to work
The langage used is JAVA (i don't use any framework) and for the save i use basic xml

that is all, this is more like a personnal project to gain some experience so move along pal
